# AI-powered-sign-language-translation-and-learning-tool
AI-powered sign language translation and learning tool that incorporates machine learning and deep learning for real-time translation and user education.
# App Features & Functional Requirements
Bidirectional Translation (Core Feature)
● Real-time translation of sign language to text/speech using a webcam or phone camera.
● Real-time translation of text/speech to sign language through a 3D animated avatar demonstrating the corresponding sign.
● Support for multiple sign languages (not just ASL).
● High accuracy and speed in recognition to ensure real-time usability.
# Interactive Learning Mode
● The app provides a random sign word or phrase in text format.
● The user performs the sign in front of the camera.
● The app analyzes the user’s sign and provides instant feedback:
○ If correct, the user moves to the next level.
○ If incorrect, the app uses a 3D model or step-by-step visualizations to guide them on how to perform the sign properly.
● The AI model should adapt and personalize learning using machine learning by tracking user progress and offering challenges based on performance.
